          This starter gives you a basic website template: a header with navigation,
          routed pages, a footer, and a touch of modern styling. Use it as a base
          to build marketing sites, docs, or personal projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Customize the colors, typography, and layout in the CSS files to match
          your brand. Add components and sections as needed.
