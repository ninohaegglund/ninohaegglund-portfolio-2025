        <p>
         I'm currently studying .NET web development in Stockholm, with a strong focus on C#, ASP.NET Core, MVC, and frontend technologies. 
         I enjoy building both full-stack applications and more structured backend systems. I also have hands-on experience with React, Tailwind, 
         and Unity for 2D game development. Passionate about clean code, problem-solving, and continuously learning — especially through real-world projects. 
         Looking for opportunities to grow as a developer in a collaborative team.
        </p>

           Passionate about expanding my knowledge and skills in this field. Demonstrated ability to handle multiple tasks in fast-paced environments. 
           Seeking to leverage these skills and experiences in a challenging role.
